# Form Validation Project

## Overview

This project is a vanilla JavaScript application that demonstrates form validation techniques for a registration form. It includes validation for various input fields such as name, email, activities, and payment details. This was my 3rd project in the Treehouse full stack JavaScript techdegree. The main focus of this project was to implement concepts we learned. For this project, traversing DOM elements was the concept.

## Features

- **Real-time Validation**: As users fill out the form, they receive immediate feedback on the validity of their inputs.
- **Dynamic UI**: The form adapts based on user selections (e.g., showing/hiding fields).
- **Total Cost Calculation**: Users can select activities, and the total cost is dynamically updated.
- **Payment Method Handling**: Users can select their preferred payment method, with relevant fields displayed based on their choice.
- **Accessibility**: The application includes focus management for better accessibility.

## Technologies Used
